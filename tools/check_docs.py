"""Guard docs/FILES.md against drift.

This checks *coverage*, not prose: it cannot tell whether a description is
still true, only whether a file exists that nobody documented, or a file is
documented that no longer exists.  That catches the common failure - a module
added without a line in the index - and leaves the judgement calls to review.

Three checks:

1. every tracked file is named in docs/FILES.md
2. every file named in docs/FILES.md exists
3. every module of the package appears in the README's layout block

Run it directly (`python3 tools/check_docs.py`); CI runs it on every push.
