"""Guard CHANGELOG.md against drift, and against losing an entry.

The second one is why this exists. Two pull requests that each add a bullet
under `## [Unreleased]` conflict on the same lines, and resolving that conflict
by hand is one keystroke away from keeping one side and dropping the other.
It happened here: the entry describing the V2 annotation document went missing
in a merge and came back two commits later, by luck rather than by a check.

Nothing can prove a resolution kept the right prose. What *can* be checked:

1. **Structure.** Every released heading has a link reference and every
   reference a heading; versions descend; `[Unreleased]` is present and its
   compare link names the newest release; `pyproject.toml` agrees with the
   newest released heading.
2. **Released sections are history.** Once a version is released its section
   is frozen: a change to it is either a mistake or a rewrite of the past.
3. **A change to the package brings an entry.** A pull request that touches
   `mocksap/` adds at least one bullet under `## [Unreleased]`, or moves the
   existing ones into a new release section - which is what cutting a release
   does. A resolution that drops the branch's own entry leaves it with none,
   and this is what says so.

(2) and (3) need something to compare against, so they run only when `--base`
names a revision this checkout has; CI passes the pull request's base. Run it
directly with no arguments and you get the structural checks.
