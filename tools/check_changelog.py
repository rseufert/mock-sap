"""Guard the changelog against drift, and against losing an entry.

The second one is why this exists. Two pull requests that each add an entry
once conflicted on the same lines, and resolving that conflict by hand is one
keystroke away from keeping one side and dropping the other. This check came to
mock-edi and mock-bank from here, where exactly that happened: an
entry went missing in a merge and came back two commits later by luck rather
than by a check.

An entry waiting for a release is now a file of its own in `changelog.d/`, so
two pull requests add two files and cannot conflict at all - the conflict was
costing more than the lost entry it risked, because a pull request that
conflicts with its base runs no CI, and seven were in that state at once on
25 September. The checks below are unchanged in what they mean; they read the
new place.

Nothing can prove a resolution kept the right prose. What *can* be checked:

1. **Structure.** Every released heading has a link reference and every
   reference a heading; versions descend; `[Unreleased]` is present and its
   compare link names the newest release; `pyproject.toml` agrees with the
   newest released heading.
2. **Released sections are history.** Once a version is released its section
   is frozen: a change to it is either a mistake or a rewrite of the past.
3. **A change to the package brings an entry.** A pull request that touches
   `mocksap/` adds at least one fragment to `changelog.d/`, or moves the ones
   waiting into a new release section - which is what cutting a release does. A resolution that drops the branch's own entry leaves it with none,
   and this is what says so. Note that "touched the changelog" would not: the
   merge that lost that entry did touch it, adding a link reference and
   dropping the prose. A change that genuinely needs no entry - a comment, a rename, a
   pure refactor - carries the `no changelog` label, which lifts this rule and
   leaves the other two standing.

(2) and (3) need something to compare against, so they run only when `--base`
names a revision this checkout has; CI passes the pull request's base. Run it
directly with no arguments and you get the structural checks.

    python3 tools/check_changelog.py
    python3 tools/check_changelog.py --base origin/main

And cutting a release assembles the fragments into a dated section:

    """The number of the pull request a merge commit's subject names, or "".

    A push to `main` carries no pull request in its event, so the workflow
    has no labels to pass and the entry rule fires on a change that was
    already excused by `no changelog` (#193). The merge commit says which
    pull request it came from, and this reads it.

    Deliberately narrow. Anything that is not GitHub's own merge subject -
    a hand-written commit, a revert, "Merge branch 'main'" - returns "", and
    the caller then has no labels and the check fails as it did before.
    Failing loudly is the point: a lookup that quietly passed would be worse
    than the bug it replaces.
